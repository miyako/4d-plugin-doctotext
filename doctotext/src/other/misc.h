	UTF16 characters take from 2 to 4 bytes length.
	Code points from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF require two bytes (so called BMP, most popular characters).
	But there are rare used characters which use codes between 0x10000 to 0x10FFFF.
	In that case utf16 character requires 4 bytes. Algorithm:

	0x10000 is subtracted from the code point, leaving a 20 bit number in the range 0..0xFFFFF.
	The top ten bits (a number in the range 0..0x3FF) are added to 0xD800 to give the first code
	unit or lead surrogate, which will be in the range 0xD800..0xDBFF (previous versions of the
	Unicode Standard referred to these as high surrogates). The low ten bits (also in the range 0..0x3FF)
	are added to 0xDC00 to give the second code unit or trail surrogate, which will be in the range
	0xDC00..0xDFFF (previous versions of the Unicode Standard referred to these as low surrogates).

	In BMP set, there are no 16-bit characters which first 6 bits have 110110 or 110111. They are reserved.

	In the following function below, we check if first two bytes require another two bytes.

	where single link lies. We have two functions to help us. If we want to "save" a space for the link in text,
	we can use insertSpecialLinkBlockIntoText function. Make sure that text is already encoded in UTF8.
